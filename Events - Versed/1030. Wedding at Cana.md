**BASED ON John 2**
	1) There was a wedding at [[Cana, Galilee]].
	2) [[Mary]], mother of [[Jesus Christ]] was there and [[Jesus Christ]] with his disciples are also invited.
	3) When the wine ran out, [[Mary]] told [[Jesus Christ]] that they have no wine left.
	4) [[Jesus Christ]] said that it was not yet the time.
	5) [[Mary]] said unto the servants to do whatever [[Jesus Christ]] told them to do.
	6) There were 6 waterpots of stone, for purifying according to the [[Jews]] tradition. Containing 2 or 3 firkins apiece (capable of twenty or thirty galloons).
	7) [[Jesus Christ]] told them to fill those waterpots with water and give those to the head steward.
	8) Then the waterpots already turned into wine when it went into the wedding.
	9) That was the first miracle of [[Jesus Christ]] and made his disciples trust him.
