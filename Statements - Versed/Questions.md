Main Questions: [There is no such thing named as the Holy Trinity]
1) Why didn't we do stuffs like Shalat? There's a history about Solomon's temple and how the Jews prayed. Even Jesus prayed by doing sujud.
2) Is it real that Torah is for Gentiles? How about the time when God declared that the Torah was early given only to the Israelites? Wasn't apostle Paul with the permission of Holy Spirit said that there are only few stuffs need to be done by the Gentiles? Say that the Torah is for everyone, isn't the Torah is half fulfilled in the cross and there are several days of celebration we didn't do?
3) The concept of Jesus' salvation. Did Jesus really forgive our sins and we shall do nothing out of it? Jesus said that if we believe in him, we do what he told him which came from God the Father. Jesus said that he'll send a Comforter to us that he described as the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit than will teach us everything we need to know that came from Jesus but did not yet taught by Jesus during his lifetime. Then, what's the teaching we need to follow?
4) Have you read the Quran? If Quran was not divine, how can it stands there for so long, just like the Bible? If Quran is tampered, isn't Bible will be more risky to get tampered? If the Bible wasn't much tampered, then ofc the Quran won't, right? To study the Bible requires you lot of effort, but not the Quran. Not to mention the doctrines which ofc make it harder. But, imagine how much effort you need to do to understand the whole Bible. Simple logic, would God let it be that way?
5) Tell me what contradicts the Quran to the Bible. The concept of Jesus' crucifixion didn't conflict, the concept of doing goods for salvation didn't conflict, the concept of whether Ishmael or Ishaq being sacrificed didn't conflict. The concept of Torah didn't conflict. Where's the conflict?
