Main Questions: [There is no such thing named as the Holy Trinity]
1) Give me every single teaching of our version of Unitarian and the base of the bible verse.
=> 

2) Why didn't we do stuffs like Sholat? There's a history about Solomon's temple and how the Jews prayed. Even Jesus prayed by doing sujud.
=> 

3) Why did we pray in the name of Jesus Christ? Didn't the apostles do that only to do miracles like healing or casting out demons? They did do the sermons about what Jesus taught them, but even they prayed only to one and only God so that they can use the name of Jesus to do things that will glorify the father. Why would we still use the name of Jesus while doing regular stuffs? How about the previous prophets and nations who didn't use the name of Jesus Christ? Is it even fair or is it even an addition over there?
=> 

4) There are verses in the Old Testament calling that God the Father is the only savior, only the Almighty with the power will not be given to any other authority. So, how are we so sure that the power given to Jesus is really given to Jesus rather than Jesus being the symbol of how powerful Jesus is (therefore he considered that God the Father is in him? ofc not making him as the God himself).
=> 

5) Jesus sacrificing his soul could be considered as the symbol of God's love (hence Karena begitu besar kasih Allah...) rather that Jesus' love. It is the salvation from God through his only son and his son only do the plans God had planned and that's why we shall not think that Jesus is the savior but still the one and only God?
=> 

6) Baptism of Jesus is from the Holy Spirit and fire. John the Baptist baptized using water because he said that's his way. The next who'll baptize will not do the same as him. Then why'd we baptize people with John's method? Even the apostles like Paul did not baptize people with water. Neither other apostles. Even the book of Acts said that they baptize people in the name of Jesus Christ making Jesus Christ baptized them (with Holy Spirit and fire rather than with water). So why do the baptism of John?
=> 

7) Is it real that Torah is for Gentiles? How about the time when God declared that the Torah was early given only to the Israelites? Wasn't apostle Paul with the permission of Holy Spirit said that there are only few stuffs need to be done by the Gentiles? Say that the Torah is for everyone, isn't the Torah is half fulfilled in the cross and there are several days of celebration we didn't do?
=> 

8) The concept of Jesus' salvation. Did Jesus really forgive our sins and we shall do nothing out of it? Jesus said that if we believe in him, we do what he told him which came from God the Father. Jesus said that he'll send a Comforter to us that he described as the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit than will teach us everything we need to know that came from Jesus but did not yet taught by Jesus during his lifetime. Then, what's the teaching we need to follow?
=> 

9) Have you read the Quran? If Quran was not divine, how can it stands there for so long, just like the Bible? If Quran is tampered, isn't Bible will be more risky to get tampered? If the Bible wasn't much tampered, then ofc the Quran won't, right? To study the Bible requires you lot of effort, but not the Quran. Not to mention the doctrines which ofc make it harder. But, imagine how much effort you need to do to understand the whole Bible. Simple logic, would God let it be that way?
=> 

10) Why don't we consider Quran a thing? Isn't Bible so complicated to understand?
=> 

11) Tell me what contradicts the Quran to the Bible. The concept of Jesus' crucifixion didn't conflict, the concept of doing goods for salvation didn't conflict, the concept of whether Ishmael or Ishaq being sacrificed didn't conflict. The concept of Torah didn't conflict. Where's the conflict?
=>
Cerita tidak utuh,

Ada beberapa kisah yang diputar balik (harusnya Ishak ternyata Ismael),
Yesus itu disalib tapi katanya mirip sprti Yesus (mereka ga paham konektivitas),

Kesan sepotong-potong jadi sebuah kitab dan author cuma nabi Muhammad yang penulisnya. Beda sama Alkitab byk penulisnya.

Lebih ke plagiasinya Alkitab lalu dikreasi ulang.
Quran itu tidak universal karena menyempurnakan.

12) So hard to find the truth in the Bible, right? Is the religion only for those geniuses or everyone?
=>
