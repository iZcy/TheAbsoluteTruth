"In the beginning was the word, and the word was with [[YHWH - GOD]] and the word was [[YHWH - GOD]]. The same was in the beginning with [[YHWH - GOD]]."

-> God Himself is the word. The word creates the word. Before the creation of that specific word, the word was with God. Being with God means that the word is still the part of God.
-> In the beginning there is nothing but God. Everything comes from God. T
