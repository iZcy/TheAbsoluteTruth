"In the beginning was the word, and the word was with [[YHWH - GOD]] and the word was [[YHWH - GOD]]. The same was in the beginning with [[YHWH - GOD]]."

-> God Himself is the word. The word creates the word. Before the creation of that specific word, the word was with God. Being with God means that the word was still the part of God.
-> In the beginning there was nothing but God. Everything comes from God. Everything was the part of God. Everything was God.
-> We were created from God, and to God we will return.
-> Because life itself was from God, because God was the life.

"[[John - The Baptist]] was sent from [[YHWH - GOD]] to be a witness of Light."
